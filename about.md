I am Reshma Abdul Razack, a passionate Computer Scientist, Research Assistant, and STEM Educator with over six years of experience across academia, research, and classroom teaching. I specialize in Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, and Mobile-Integrated Systems â€” blending technical innovation with a deep commitment to learner success.
Currently, I serve as a Research Assistant at the University of Sharjah, where I work on Arabic computational linguistics and assistive technologies such as real-time language translation. Alongside my technical work, I actively teach and mentor students in computing, robotics, and digital innovation, both in UAE and internationally.
